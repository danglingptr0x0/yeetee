## A TUI YouTube client

This is a basic YouTube client with OAuth2 device flow login support. My goal was to make the experience of using it as smooth as possible. The creds configured are well-known "smart TV" creds that anyone can use.
Currently, the project depends on my private library, though I'm working on getting it done and FLOSS-ing it within the next couple of days (as of Feb 8, 2026).
